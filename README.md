üõçÔ∏è E-Commerce Website with ReactJS, Redux, and API Integration Built an responsive e-commerce website using ReactJS and Redux. Fetches products dynamically from an API and manages the shopping cart. Demonstrates modern front-end practices for a seamless user experience. Tech: ReactJS, Redux, API Integration.
This is a Demo E-commerce Web App. To show the main functionality of an Ecommerce Project with Redux Toolkit. I have used Fake Store API as a dummy API to get the products.

Till now:

User Can search or browse products and see the product detail page.
Add product to cart and in the cart page increment and decrements products and also remove products from the cart.
Users can see suggested products on each product's detail page.
Wishlist functionality based on local storage.
Users can filter products by category.
I have not implemented any authentication for this project yet. I have used the Redux toolkit for state management purposes.
